    <h1>What does it mean to be a rat??? I have found lots of answers </h1>
    

        <p> I have had a hard time since my wife decided to divorce me. :( 
            I am sad I night and I am restraining from posting sad gifs on social media I think to myself
            what does it mean to live? Do I want to cook all the time? Is there more than just food? I have considered
            following out my dream of making music. I have always had an interest in the subject, but I have never
            been able to have someone support me in the process. What if I quit it all and threw it all away? These are
            the things that I think about at night. If the world had one less chef and one more gangster rapper, would 
            it be a better place? I think yes.
