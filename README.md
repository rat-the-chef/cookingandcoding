# cookingandcoding
this where I share tips on cooking and coding

## Cooking 
Here are a few of my goals for this repo
- To make an automate music playlist that dims the light whenever romantic music comes on 
- To show stuart little who's boss!!!

## Coding
These are some tips which help me code
- Find a quiet room where you can focus ( this always allows me to make sure I am not distracted)
- Someone who you can control when coding; Think about it, if I need to control a human while I cook Imagine how hard it would be to control a huan while I code?!?!?!

Thank you for coming to my ted talk
